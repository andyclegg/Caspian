== Cell based approach ==

A cell in the output grid can only be stated to represent a polygon over the earth's surface
 - For a geographic projection, this cell is simple - a square (in terms of latlon)
 - At the other end, a stereographic projection has a complex polygon

For every pixel in the output grid, the corresponding cell must be generated (in terms of latlon). We can navigate
the projection plane in its native units (metres?). 


== Preprocessed approach ==
Project all points as they are loaded - load the points into the data structure as normal. Simply walk the output grid,
generate cells in terms of map units (metres), then apply the data reduction.
 - Exactly mimics ms2gt in terms of preprojecting the data, but still allows for much finer control of data reduction.
 - Need to specify the area in terms of central lat/lon, h/v res, and h/v pixels (be careful to allow both odd and even sizes)
 - Disadvantage: Can only reuse index for each product (not for each area as before)
