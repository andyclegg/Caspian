CASPIAN - Modern gridding software for spatial data

== Building ==

Run 'make'. The only non-standard library used is PROJ.4. Caspian and a few
utilities will be compiled and copied to the /bin directory.

Run 'make docs' to prepare the documentation. The documentation comes in 2
parts: a PDF user guide, and a HTML API reference guide. Required programs to
build the documentation are Latex, latexmk, and doxygen.

For convenience if any debugging is necessary, a debug build can be built. Run
'make debug'. You may also run the suite of unit tests by running 'make check'
(the 'check' library is required for this).

== Using ==
Run bin/caspian --help for usage information. See the built docs for a higher
level description.

== Known Issues / Limitations ==
When mapping coded data, input fill value is ignored and output fill value is
hardcoded to 0.
