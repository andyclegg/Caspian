CASPIAN - Modern gridding software for spatial data

== Building ==
Run 'make'. The only non-standard library used is PROJ.4.

Run 'make docs' to build documentation, which uses LaTeX (and latexmk to build).

For convenience, a debug build can be built. Run 'make debug'

The mapping function is selected at compile time (currently, this may change later). To select the mapping function, edit the Makefile and change the DFLAGS from '-DREDUCE_MEDIAN' to another value (currently -DREDUCE_MEAN, -DREDUCE_NEAREST_NEIGHBOUR)

== Using ==
Run bin/caspian --help for usage information. See the built docs for a higher level description.
