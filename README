CASPIAN - Modern gridding software for spatial data

== Building ==
Run 'make'. The only non-standard library used is PROJ.4.

Run 'make docs' to build documentation, which uses LaTeX (and latexmk to build).

For convenience, a debug build can be built. Run 'make debug'

== Using ==
Run bin/caspian --help for usage information. See the built docs for a higher level description.

== Known Issues / Limitations ==
When mapping coded data, input fill value is ignored and output fill value is hardcoded to 0.
